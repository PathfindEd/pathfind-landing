      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: 23rd November 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Pathfind Education Ltd ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and share your data when you use our services to apply for university study abroad.</p>
      <p>We are a company registered in the United Kingdom (Company Number: 16768409). Our registered office is 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, WC2H 9JQ, London, UK.</p>

      <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>To provide our education consultancy services, we may collect the following personal data. We treat any document that confirms your identity (such as a passport) or academic history (transcripts) with the highest level of security.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Identity Data:</strong> Name, date of birth, **passport details or National ID copy**.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> Email address, phone number, physical address.</li>
          <li><strong>Academic Data:</strong> **Transcripts**, certificates, English language scores (IELTS/TOEFL), CVs, and personal statements.</li>
          <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Bank statements or financial guarantees (used solely for university application proof purposes).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use your personal data for the following lawful purposes, which are essential to deliver our contracted service to you:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>To assess your eligibility for university courses.</li>
          <li>To submit applications to universities on your behalf.</li>
          <li>To communicate with you regarding your application status.</li>
          <li>To refer you to authorised partners for further processing (such as visa compliance).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3a. Legal Basis for Processing Sensitive Documents (UK GDPR)</h3>
      <p>Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), we must have a legal basis to process your data. For the high-risk documents (Passport copies and Academic Transcripts), our legal basis is **Contractual Necessity** (Article 6(1)(b)).</p>
      <p><strong>This means:</strong> We cannot perform our service—specifically, verifying your identity and academic eligibility to submit a legitimate university application—without collecting and processing these documents as per the terms agreed upon in our Terms & Conditions.</p>

      <h2>4. Sharing Your Data</h2>
      <p>We only share your data with necessary third parties to fulfill our service to you:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Universities & Educational Institutions:</strong> To process your admissions application.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Platforms:</strong> Authorised aggregator platforms (such as ApplyBoard, Adventus, UpGrad) through which we submit applications. These platforms may process your data for visa compliance purposes in accordance with their own policies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your data to marketing agencies.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We adhere strictly to the principle of Storage Limitation. We only retain your personal data for defined periods necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Our retention schedule is:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Operational Documents (Passports, Transcripts):</strong> Retained for a maximum of <strong>12 months</strong> following the date the student’s application is finalised (successful enrollment or final rejection). This period is required to address administrative queries, appeals, or minor compliance checks related to the submission process.</li>
          <li><strong>Contractual & Financial Records:</strong> Retained for a maximum of <strong>7 years</strong> to comply with UK accounting and legal reporting obligations.</li>
          <li>All data is securely destroyed or permanently anonymised upon reaching its retention deadline.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Security and Safeguards</h2>
      <p>We are committed to ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of your personal data, especially sensitive documents. We have implemented robust technical and organisational security measures (GDPR Article 32) to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All sensitive documents are collected and stored on secure cloud services where data is protected by **AES-256 encryption** both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.</li>
          <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to sensitive documents (passports, transcripts) is strictly limited via **role-based access control (RBAC)** to only the Pathfind Education staff whose roles explicitly require document verification for application submission.</li>
          <li><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> We maintain detailed audit logs of who accessed which documents and when, ensuring accountability.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Upload:</strong> We utilize dedicated, secure document portals (not standard email or consumer cloud storage) for the initial collection of high-risk PII.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>As we use third-party cloud service providers (e.g., Google Cloud, secure portal hosts), your data may be stored on servers located outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK/EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by utilizing the following safeguards:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Ensuring the recipient is based in a country deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the UK government.</li>
          <li>Where adequacy is not confirmed, we use specific contracts approved for use in the UK (e.g., **Standard Contractual Clauses - SCCs**) which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK/EEA.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>8. Your Rights (UK GDPR)</h2>
      <p>Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), you have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
          <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
          <li>Request erasure of your personal data ("Right to be forgotten").</li>
          <li>Withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:Info@pathfindeducation.com">Info@pathfindeducation.com</a></p>

      <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:Info@pathfindeducation.com">Info@pathfindeducation.com</a>.</p>
